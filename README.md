[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3a011c97c33f411d8c58f03c1bfaa01b)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/NoahvdAa/DontMention/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=NoahvdAa/DontMention&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Don't mention allows your discord members to mark themselves as not wanting to be pinged. When someone *does* ping one of your members that don't want to be pinged, whether it's directly or via a reply, Don't Mention will inform them that the member in question doesn't want to be pinged.
